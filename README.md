# Fractal-Now-Config-Generator
This is a python script that will generate config files for the FractalNow fractal generation software.  The generated files produced by the script are completely random, and can be used alone to generate fractals.
FractalNow (script is pretty useless without this):
http://fractalnow.sourceforge.net/

If you know how to use FractalNow, you know how to use my script.
Just run it in python, and the configuration files should start popping out.
